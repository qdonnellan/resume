Since 2008 I have taught Geometry, Physics, Astronomy, Calculus, and Engineering. I grew the Astronomy program from less than 20 students to over 120. I doubled the enrollement in AP Calculus and produced more students with passing AP scores in school history. I am a vocal member of the district's technolgoy committee. \\

\\
An after school program which teaches students the fundamentals of robotics and programming. Our vision is to develop this into a pathway through which students earn marketable skills oustide exising education frameworks. My roles: teaching, writing curriculum, managing our website/curriculum webapp.
